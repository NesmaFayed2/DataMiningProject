# Obesity Data Analysis and Classification

This project involves analyzing and classifying obesity data using various machine learning models. The dataset used is the "ObesityDataSet.csv," which includes features related to demographics, lifestyle, and health status.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
2. **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Train and evaluate a decision tree model.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Train and evaluate a KNN model.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Train and evaluate a random forest model.
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Perform clustering and analyze results.
5. **Ensemble Learning**: Use Bagging with decision trees for improved performance.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-plot`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
